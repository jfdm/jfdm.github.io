abstract = {Design patterns are supposed to be the well documented, tried and tested solutions to recurrent problems. Current evaluation techniques do not provide a demonstrable and holistic means to evaluate pattern quality. This paper introduces Pattern Report Cards an evaluation process for software design patterns that is demonstrable, measurable, and reproducible. A set of quality indicators for determining pattern quality has been identified, and a set of qualitative and quantitative evaluation techniques assembled to determine the quality of adherence to these indicators. Further, management and execution of the evaluation process is controlled by the PREMES framework. This framework describes a management cycle that facilitates the construction of bespoke evaluation systems for design patterns. Process tailoring is achieved by providing guidance over the selection and construction of the techniques used to assess pattern quality. Use of these techniques will help bolster existing evaluation processes, and lead to the improvement of design pattern evaluation techniques.},
