This week, I gave a talk about my work on the [Border
Patrol](https://border-patrol.github.io) at the Autumn 2017 session of
[SPLS](http://simonjf.com/spls-oct2017/).


> The Border Patrol Project seeks to investigate how state-of-the-art
> advances in programming language theory can provide better
> guarantees towards System-On-Chip (SoC) design and
> execution. Specifically we are interested in extending existing work
> on structural type systems for SoC with that of Multi-Party Session
> Types and Dependent Types.

> In this talk I will: briefly discuss the goals of the Border Patrol
> Project; outline some of the design challenges we have encountered
> so far when looking to adapt multi-party session types for
> describing hardware; and demonstrate how dependent types help reason
> about the structure of SoC architectures.
