Today I gave a talk about my work
at [SPLS Nov '16](https://msp-strath.github.io/spls-16/) at the
University of Strathclyde.

> The idea of communicating systems is a cornerstone of modern
> technology that allows heterogeneous collections of components to
> communicate through well-defined communication patterns. However,
> there is a disconnect between the tooling and languages used to
> design, implement and reason about communication protocols.

> Idris is a general purpose programming language that supports
> full-dependent types, providing programmers with the ability to
> reason more precisely about programs. Inspired by work on Session
> types, our research looks to leverage dependent types to describe
> and reason about secure communication patterns and their
> implementation in different communication contexts.

> This talk presents our current progress and introduces sessions, a
> library for describing, and reasoning about, the interactions of a
> communicating system. Demonstrated is use of sessions to describe
> common communication patterns, and how the library enforces
> correctness of the pattern itself through type-level guarantees.

> Given time future work will also be presented detailing our next
> steps in linking these descriptions to implementations such that
> compile time correctness guarantees over the actions of an entity in
> a communicating system can be given respective to known
> specification.
