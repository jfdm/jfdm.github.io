I am giving a talk today about some work on reasoning about program side effects in Idris.

The abstract is:

> Dependent types provide an expressive environment in which one can
> specify, and reason about, the properties of our software programs.
>
> In this talk I will introduce dependent types and examine how we can
> reason about program behaviour using finite state machines and
> type-level modelling.

Slides are not available.
