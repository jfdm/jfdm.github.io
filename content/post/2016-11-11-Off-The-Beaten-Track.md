I submitted a talk entitled *Type-Driven Development of Security Protocols* to [Off-The-Beaten-Track '17](http://popl17.sigplan.org/track/OBT-2017).

I have decided to uploaded the abstract here so that my attempt is a least indexable by the great machine spirit in the web---Hallowed be thy API.
Given time I will also upload a copy of the paper to ArXiV.

The abstract is:

> Implementing security protocols correctly is hard; verifying them is
> too. However, we also implement them in languages different to those
> we verify them in. With dependent types we can reason on software with
> greater precision and link specifications to implementations. In this
> talk we examine how state-of-the-art programming language research can
> help us to verify and implement protocols in the same language.
