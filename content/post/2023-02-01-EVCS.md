A bittersweet announcement: I am pleased to announce that, together with my co-authors Edwin Brady (of St Andrews) & Guillaume Allais (soon to be of Strathclyde), we have a paper accepted to the [Eelco Visser Commemorative Symposium 2023](https://symposium.eelcovisser.org/).

The work argues how we can link dependently-typed languages with language work benches, and highlights many of the techniques that Guillaume and I use when formally mechanising language's in Idris2/Agda. The abstract is below:

> Language Workbenches offer language designers an expressive
> environment in which to create theirDomain Specific Languages
> (DSLs). Similarly, research into mechanised meta-theory has shownhow
> dependently-typed languages provide expressive environments to
> formalise and study DSLs andtheir meta-theoretical properties. But
> can we claim that dependently-typed languages qualify as language
> workbenches? We argue yes!We have developed an exemplar DSL called
> Vélo that showcases not only dependently-typedtechniques to realise
> and manipulate Intermediate Representations (IRs), but that
> dependently-typedlanguages make fine language workbenches. Vélo is a
> simple verified language with well-typed holesand comes with a
> complete compiler pipeline: parser, elaborator, REPL, evaluator, and
> compilerpasses. Specifically, we describe our design choices for
> well-typed IR design that includes supportfor well-typed holes, how
> Common Sub-Expression Elimination (CSE) is achieved in a
> well-typedsetting, and how the mechanised type-soundness proof for
> Vélo is the source of the evaluator.
