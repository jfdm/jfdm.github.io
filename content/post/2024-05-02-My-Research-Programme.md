On May 1st, 2024 I attending the first
[SPLI Industry Engagement Event](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/04-spli24-industry.html)
at the University of Edinburgh.

As part of that event I presented a poster detailing my own research interests and topics that I want to work on.
Rather than keeping the poster secret I thought I would share it here.

Et voila:
