Starting September 2023 I will be joining the
[University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/)
as a Lecturer in Cybersecurity as part of
[Computer & Information Sciences](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/)
, where I will be a member of the
[StrathCyber group](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/strathcyber/)
and be the bridge with the
[MSP Group](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/).

At Strathclyde I will be continuing [my research](page/research) investigating how we can take programming language theory and technologies, namely type-systems, dependent types, & functional programming, and use them to fundamentally change systems to make them more trustworthy:
Secure and Safe.

If you are interested in student projects or research studies when I am in post at Strathclyde then [please read this](page/studying).
If you are interested in working with me as a research associate then [please read this](page/working)


In the mean time I am still a Research Associate at the [School of Computing](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/), [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk)
looking at using programming language theory and technologies to investigate bettering hardware design.
Specifically, I investigated how to use quantitative typing to reason better about wiring, and I am currently investigating the interplay between System languages, Session Types, and CHERI Hardware capabilities.

At Glasgow, I am a member of the
[Glasgow Parallelism Group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/gpg/) (GPG)
as part of the
[Glasgow Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/) (GLASS).
I also maintain strong links with the
[Formal Methods Research Group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/formalmethods/)
in
[Formal Analysis, Theory & Algorithms](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/fata-section/) (FATA) Section
through membership of the
[Programming Languages](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/pl-theme/) (PL) Theme.
Further, I am part of the wider
[Scottish Programming Languages Institute](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/)
that offers a framework to better the interaction of programming language researchers across Scotland.

Before I came to Glasgow I was a Research Fellow (and Teaching Fellow) at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/), [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk).
I completed both my PhD and undergraduate degrees at the University of St Andrews, and in between these degrees I was a Master student (as part of the now defunct Kerckhoffs Institute) at the [Institute for Information & Computer Science](https://www.ru.nl/icis/), [Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) in the Netherlands.
