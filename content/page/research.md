title: "TyDe Systems are Trusthworthy Systems!"
---

## Interests

I am interested in how we can take state-of-the-art programming language theory and technologies, namely type-systems, dependent types, & functional programming, and use them to fundamentally change how we design systems to make them more trustworthy:
Secure and Safe.

Specifically, I am interested in bettering system design and construction through applications of:

+ functional programming;
+ formal verification;
+ mathematically informed programming;
+ dependent types;
+ sub-structural typing (quantitative, resource-dependent, session); and
+ algebraic effect handlers.

There are more topics that I am interested in, but the above keeps me busy for now!

## Vision

The security of our Digital Technologies is paramount as Society and the Economy becomes evermore digital. Fundamentally, there
is a separation-of-concerns between system: specification—by domain experts; verification—by verification experts; creation—by
software engineers; use—by end users; and certification—by auditors. Such a disconnect leads to issues over system trustworthiness
by allowing potentially exploitable vulnerabilities and errors to be present at various points during a system’s lifecycle.

Type-Driven (TyDe) techniques see the creation of expressive type systems to capture the structural and behavioural specifications
our programs have. It is through the type checking process that we can provide static design time guarantees that a system does
indeed follow its specification. Through adoption of TyDe techniques we can: reduce mismatches between a system’s specification
and implementation; increase productivity of system creation and verification; and fundamentally enhance system trustworthiness.
This will benefit both Society and the Economy by guaranteeing that our systems are trustworthy because our engineering practises
are also trustworthy.

In Welsh English the word ‘tidy’ describes anything that is positive, good, neat. . . . I want to make engineering tidy. What better way
of doing so by making our engineering practices: Type-Driven!


## Projects

+ [**AppControl**](https://dsbd-appcontrol.github.io) is an [EPSRC funded research project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V000462/1) that is part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund: [Digital Security by Design](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/iscf-digital-security-by-design-research-projects/).
The project is a collaboration between the Universities of Glasgow, Imperial College London, and Essex.
This project's goal is to improve upon the trustworthiness of Hardware/Software Co-Design by combining the results of **Border Patrol** with that of Capability Hardware as developed by the [CHERI Program](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/dsbd.html).


+ [**Border Patrol**](https://border-patrol.github.io) is an [EPSRC funded research project](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N028201/1) that is part of the [Trust, Identity, Privacy and Security in the Digital Economy](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/trustidentityprivacysecurity/) call.
The project is a collaboration project between the Universities of Glasgow, Heriot-Watt, and Imperial College London.
The project's goal is to make the design of hardware systems, and in particular smart devices, resiliant against hidden malicious functionality by ensuring that devices only do what is expected of them. It is an ambitious project that combines state-of-the-art advances in type theory and compiler technology, and applies them to hardware design.

+ **Idris** is a general purpose dependently typed language.
I have been involved with the project for many years as developer and community participant.
I help administer the Github project pages for the compiler and community.

+ **Ola** is a personal project that sees me try and implement reference implementations of different styles of programming languages within Idris2.
  Mostly for pedagogical reasons.
  I have not seen reasons to write them up as academic papers.
  So far there have been two 'main' languages: [Olaf](https://github.com/jfdm/olaf-lang) & [Olai](https://github.com/jfdm/olai-lang).

<!--
+ **BiGraphER** I am currently getting involved with the [BigraphER project](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~michele/bigrapher.html).
Bigraphs are an interesting formalism for modelling communicating systems.
I am applying my expertise in dependent types to help further reason about domain specific bigraphical models.

### Previous Projects

+ **Security by Design and Construction** was a six-month project looking at type-driven verification of communicating systems. I was employed as an RA to investigate how to use dependent types and algebraic effect handlers to reason about communicating systems.

+ **Type-Driven Verification of Communicating Systems** was a one year EPSRC first grant to investigate the use of dependent types to reason about communicating systems. I was responsible for development of a *Multiparty Session Type* inspired EDSL and corresponding runtime.

## Software

Software that I develop for both work and other reasons.
There are more repo's on GitHub but I will list important ones here.
