Currently, I have no funded positions available for research associates and assistants.

When I do have project related positions available, they will be advertised through the normal channels: social media; and on jobs.ac.uk

Another approach is to _jointly_ apply for funding for a bespoke position.
Example, funding sources are:
[Marie Curie Actions](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about/individual-fellowships_en);
[Royal Academy of Engineering](http://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-and-prizes/support-for-research/raeng-research-fellowship);
and
[Royal Commission 1851](https://www.royalcommission1851.org/).
If you _are_ interested then please do contact me so that we can chat about it _before you submit your application_.
I would be grateful if you can mention in your initial email _why my work interests you_, and detail any ideas you have that align with my research interests.
If I feel that we are a good match I will work with you to develop your application.
