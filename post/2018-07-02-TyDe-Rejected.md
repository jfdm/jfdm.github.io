I submitted a paper entitled *Fake it until they make it: Implementing Substructural Type-Systems for EDSLs using Dependent Types* to [Type-Driven Development '18](https://icfp18.sigplan.org/track/tyde-2018)

I have decided to uploaded the abstract here so that my attempt is a least indexable by the great machine spirit in the web---Hallowed be thy API. Gvien time I will also upload a copy of the paper to ArXiV.

The paper's abstract was:

> Many substructural type-systems are presented for general purpose
> languages, reasoning about structural rules referencing memory
> access, and variable usage. When looking to design Embedded Domain
> Specific Languages (EDSLs) we utilise the host language’s
> functionality to reason about, and provide, domain specific
> properties. If the host language does support substructural typing,
> the substructural rules are specific to the general purpose host
> language. We build upon existing work that utilises parameterised
> monads and dependent types when implementing substructural
> type-systems for EDSLs where the host language does not support
> omain specific, nor customisation of, substructural type-systems. We
> extend this work to use De Bruijn indices as proofs of existence
> that a language’s substructural properties hold. Further, we present
> two exemplar languages that illustrate the technique’s core
> principles and how dependent types provide correctness guarantees
> that our EDSL programs are well-typed.
