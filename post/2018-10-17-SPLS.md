I am giving a talk about my work on the [Border
Patrol Project](https://border-patrol.github.io) at [SPLS Oct '18](https://msp-strath.github.io/spls-18/) at the [University of
Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/).
This event is being hosted by the [MSP Group](http://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/) of the [School of Computer and Information Sciences](http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/).

This talk extends upon early talks to the MSP Group, FP-StAnd Group, and PL Interest groups, with an even more complete picture of the language and how it is used.
Sadly, this talk won't be *Chalk&Talk*, and a more conventional slidedeck will be used.

> The protocols that describe the interactions between IP Cores on
> System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architectures are well-documented, describing
> not only the structural properties of the physical interfaces but
> also the behaviour of the emanating signals.  However, there is a
> disconnect between the design of SoC architectures, their formal
> description, and the verification of their implementation in known
> hardware description languages.
>
> Within the Border Patrol project we are investigating how to model
> the structural and behavioural properties of SoC architectures using
> state-of-the-art advances in programming language research.  Namely,
> we are investigating how dependent types and session types can be
> leveraged to model hardware communication at design and runtime.
>
> In this talk I will discuss my work in designing a modelling
> language with a substructural type-system that reasons about the
> structure of SoC Architectures.  This language provide
> correct-by-construction guarantees over:
>
> + the physical structure of an interaction protocol;
> + the adherence of a componentâ€™s interface to a given protocol; and
> + the validity of the connections made between components.
>
> We provide these guarantees by: (ab)using dependent types as
> presented within Idris; using novel ideas from programming language
> design such as Session Types and Thinnings; and incorporating novel
> ideas to reason about effectful programs, namely Hoare Monads and
> Resource-Dependent Algebraic Effects.
