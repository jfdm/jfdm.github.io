title: Dependent Types and Goal-Oriented DSMLs

I submitted a paper entitled [*Using Dependent Types to Build Domain Specific Goal-Oriented Modelling Languages*](http://jfdm.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/drafts/2015-GPCE-Rejected.pdf) to GPCE '15.
Sadly it was rejected.
I have decided to uploaded it here, warts and all, so that it is a least indexable by the great machine spirit in the web---Hallowed be thy API.

The abstract is:

> The Goal Requirements Language (GRL) has been used as a host
> language for the creation of Domain Specific Goal-Oriented Modelling
> Languages (DSMLs). The pictorial language constructs, however, do
> not allow for a more formal language-driven treatment to be given
> for DSMLs created in the GRL. Dependent types allow for more precise
> reasoning to be made about programs. This paper describes the GStar
> framework that uses of dependent types to reason on the construction
> of DSMLs based on the GRL. Two styles of DSML construction are
> presented. The first allows for structurally equivalent DSML to be
> created that differ in terminology and semantic constructs. The
> second facilitates the construction of structurally different DSMLs
> that have the same evaluation semantics. Both techniques allows for
> a direct correspondence to be made between the semantics and
> structure of the host language and domain language.

Constructive comments and suggestions are welcome.
This paper introduces several techniques that I have developed as part of my PhD work in creating machine-checkable design patterns.
