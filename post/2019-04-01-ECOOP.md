I am *very* pleased to announce that my paper describing a type-system for hardware interfaces was accepted to [ECOOP 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecoop-2019/).
This was joint work with Wim Vanderbauwhede as part of the Border Patrol project.

> Modern Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC) are constructed by composition of IP
> (Intellectual Property) cores. There are well described interaction
> protocols for communication between IP Cores. However, there is a
> disconnect between the machine readable specification of these
> protocols and the verification of their implementation in known
> hardware description languages. Although tools can be written to
> address such a separation of concerns, such tooling is often hand
> written and used to check hardware designs a posteriori. We have
> developed a dependent type-system and proof-of-concept modelling
> language to reason about the physical structure of hardware
> interfaces respective to user provided descriptions. Our type-system
> provides correct-by-construction guarantees that the interfaces on
> an IP Core will be well-typed if they adhere to a specified
> standard.

More details will follow in the coming months, and also around the time of the conference.
