title: Should PLDI join PACM-PL?
...

On 2022-06-09, the [PLDI Twitter](https://twitter.com/PLDI) tweeted their intent to _solicit the PLDI community_ [^1] on a matter relating to publishing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should <a href="https://twitter.com/PLDI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pldi</a> join ICFP, OOPSLA and POPL in publishing its proceedings in the PACM-PL journal? The PLDI Steering Committee would appreciate your views. Please complete this short survey before the end of Thursday 16 June (AoE): <a href="https://t.co/weH2tlnfGd">https://t.co/weH2tlnfGd</a><br><br>[please RT]</p>&mdash; PLDI (@PLDI) <a href="https://twitter.com/PLDI/status/1534937508760281091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I have filled in the survey, but more importantly [Sam Tobin-Hochstadt](https://twitter.com/samth/) posted about the importance of the poll **together** with a copy of his comments to the survey.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you care about academic publishing in PL, please fill out this survey.<br><br>One important aspect is that joining PACMPL would make PLDI open-access, which is important! (It&#39;s possible to do that w/o joining, but it would be more expensive and the PLDI organizers haven&#39;t done it.) <a href="https://t.co/LVNQyk8WKz">https://t.co/LVNQyk8WKz</a></p>&mdash; Sam Tobin-Hochstadt (@samth) <a href="https://twitter.com/samth/status/1534938303190925318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I thought I would too publish my comment, which by & large, echo's Sam's response.

The reason I wish to do this is to help promote the views of the Community in an open forum so that one's voice is not considered in isolation in private by a committee, but heard by everyone else so we know where each other stands.

## My Statement

I believe that PLDI should join its fellow SIGPLAN conferences and join the PACM-PL journal.

1. Currently PLDI is not Open Access, which is fast becoming a requirement of many funding councils. Joining PACM-PL would provide a good opportunity to make PLDI Open Access in a timely manner without causing the PLDI organisers the pain of doing it for themselves.
2. This would harmonise the submission format across the major SIGPLAN conferences. Without ruminating on why (i.e. review quality & PC selection judgement) many an author has wasted time reformatting their fine submission from one SIGPLAN conference to the next. This is wasted effort that could be harnessed in furthering the research, such wasted time is detrimental to our community as a whole.
3. With the evolution of digital publishing tooling, as used by the ACM that supports reflowable online documents together with PDFs, it does not make sense to use two-column formats that are invariably hard to read on mobile devices.


[^1]: by solicit I mean they tweet it but I am not sure if there are efforts to go through the various mailing lists like one would a _Call for Participation_.
