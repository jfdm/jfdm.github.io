## Projects

+ **Border Patrol** is an [EPSRC funded research project](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N028201/1) as part of the [Trust, Identity, Privacy and Security in the Digital Economy](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/trustidentityprivacysecurity/) call.
It is a collaborative project between the Universities of Glasgow, Heriot-Watt, and Imperial College London.
The project's goal is to make the design of hardware systems, and in particular smart devices, resiliant against hidden malicious functionality by ensuring that devices only do what is expected of them. It is an ambitious project that combines state-of-the-art advances in type theory and compiler technology, and applies them to hardware design.

+ **Idris** is a general purpose dependently typed language.
I have been involved with the project for many years as developer and community participant.
I help administer the Github project pages for the compiler and community.

+ **BiGraphER** I am currently getting involved with the [BigraphER project](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~michele/bigrapher.html).
Bigraphs are an interesting formalism for modelling communicating systems.
I am applying my expertise in dependent types to help further reason about domain specific bigraphical models.

### Previous Projects

+ **Security by Design and Construction** was a six-month project looking at type-driven verification of communicating systems. I was employed as an RA to investigate how to use dependent types and algebraic effect handlers to reason about communicating systems.

+ **Type-Driven Verification of Communicating Systems** was a one year EPSRC first grant to investigate the use of dependent types to reason about communicating systems. I was responsible for development of a *Multiparty Session Type* inspired EDSL and corresponding runtime.


## Software

Software that I develop for both work and other reasons.
There are more repo's on GitHub but I will list important ones here.
