...


I am a Research Associate at the [School of Computing](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/), [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk).

My core research role is to investigate how we can leverage state-of-the-art advances in programming language theory to build more trustworth systems.
Current and past work has seen me look at bettering hardware design languages with resource-dependent typing to reason better about how circuits and modules are wired.
I am now starting to shift my investigation to see how we can design better type-systems for high-level languages that take advantage of CHERI capabilities.
Generally speaking, my other research interests are: type-driven development of trustworthy systems using dependent-types & session-types; and how to best teach state-of-the-art advances in programming language theory.

At Glasgow, I am a member of the [Glasgow Parallelism Group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/gpg/) (GPG) as part of the [Glasgow Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/) (GLASS).
I maintain strong links with the [Formal Methods Research Group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/formalmethods/) in [Formal Analysis, Theory & Algorithms](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/fata-section/) (FATA) Section through membership of the [Programming Languages](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/pl-theme/) (PL) Theme.
Further, I am part of the wider [Scottish Programming Languages Institute](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/) that offers a framework to better the interaction of programming language researchers across Scotland.

Before I came to Glasgow I was a Research Fellow (and Teaching Fellow) at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/), [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk).
I completed both my PhD and undergraduate degrees at the at the University of St Andrews, and in between these degrees I was a Master student (as part of the now defunct Kerckhoffs Institute) at the [Institute for Information & Computer Science](https://www.ru.nl/icis/), [Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) in the Netherlands.
