...

I am a Research Associate at the [School of Computing at the University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/), where I am a member of the [Glasgow Parallelism Group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/gpg/) (GPG) as part of the [Glasgow Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/) (GLASS).
I maintain strong links with the [Formal Methods Research Group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/research/formalmethods/) in [Formal Analysis, Theory & Algorithms](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/fata-section/) (FATA) Section through membership of the [Programming Languages](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/pl-theme/) (PL) Theme.

My core role at Glasgow is to investigate the construction and application of structural and behavioural type-systems for hardware design languages.
My other research interests are in the general type-driven development of systems using dependent types, session types, and algebraic effect handlers.

Before I came to Glasgow I was a Research Fellow (and Teaching Fellow) at the [School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/). I completed both my PhD and undergraduate degrees at the at the University of St Andrews, and in between these degrees I was a Kerckhoffs Master student at the [Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/icis/) in the Netherlands.
