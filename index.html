<h2>Jan de Muijnck-Hughes</h2>

<p>
  I am a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews investigating Type-Driven Verification of Security Protocols using Dependent Types, Session Types, Algebraic Effects, and EDSLs as combined withing the dependently typed language <a href="http://www.idris-lang.org">Idris</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to beginning my PhD studies, I was a Kerckhoffs Master student at the Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in the Netherlands, and completed my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews.

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>I work in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/fp">Functional Programming</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/se">Systems Engineering</a> research groups.
</p>
<p>
  My main area of interest is addressing the usability of novel cryptographic systems through pattern and type based approaches. My PhD thesis investigated the improvement of pattern-based approaches using domain specific modelling languages, and the improvement of domain modelling using language oriented type-driven constructions using dependent types. Outside of these areas I am also interested in other aspects of security, privacy and trust, from both a technical and socio-technical standpoint. I am also heavily interested in language based security using dependent types and formal methods.
