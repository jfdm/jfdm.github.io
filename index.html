<h2>Cou Cou!</h2>

<p>I am a PhD student in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews. Prior to beginning my PhD studies, I was a Kerckhoffs Master student at the Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in the Netherlands, and completed my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>I work in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/fp">Functional Programming</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/se">Systems Engineering</a> research groups.
</p>
<p>My main area of interest is addressing the usability of novel cryptographic systems through pattern-based approaches. My thesis looks at the improvement of pattern-based approaches using domain specific modelling languages, and the improvement of domain modelling using language oriented type-driven constructions using dependent types. Outside of these areas I am also interested in other aspects of security, privacy and trust, from both a technical and socio-technical standpoint. I am also interested in language based security using dependent types and formal methods.
