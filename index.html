title: About
...

<p>I am a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing at the University of Glasgow</a>, where I am a member of the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchoverview/systems-section/">GLASS</a> Research Group. My core role at Glasgow is too investigate the construction of Structural and Behavioural Type-Systems for hardware design on the EPSRC Funded <a href="http://border-patrol.github.io">Border Patrol Project</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Generally speaking, my research interests are revolved around the Type-Driven Development of Communicating Systems using Dependent Types, Session Types, and Algebraic Effects as presented in the dependently typed programming language <a href="http://www.idris-lang.org">Idris</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to Glasgow, I was a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews investigating Type-Driven Development of Communicating Systems using Idris. I completed my PhD at the University of St Andrews with a thesis entitled: <i>Machine Checkeable Design Patterns using Dependent Types and Domain Specific Goal-Oriented Modelling Languages</i>.

<p>
  Prior to my PhD studies, I was a Kerckhoffs Master student at the Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in the Netherlands, and completed my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews.

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>I work in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/fp">Functional Programming</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/se">Systems Engineering</a> research groups.
</p>
<p>
  My main area of interest is addressing the usability of novel cryptographic systems through pattern and type based approaches. My PhD thesis investigated the improvement of pattern-based approaches using domain specific modelling languages, and the improvement of domain modelling using language oriented type-driven constructions using dependent types. Outside of these areas I am also interested in other aspects of security, privacy and trust, from both a technical and socio-technical standpoint. I am also heavily interested in language based security using dependent types and formal methods.
