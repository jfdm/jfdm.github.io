  abstract =     { The protocols that describe the interactions
                  between IP Cores on System-on-a-Chip architectures
                  are well-documented. These protocols described not
                  only the structural properties of the physical
                  interfaces but also the behaviour of the emanating
                  signals. However, there is a disconnect between the
                  design of SoC architectures, their formal
                  description, and the verification of their
                  implementation in known hardware description
                  languages.  Within the Border Patrol project we are
                  investigating how to capture and reason about the
                  structural and behavioural properties of SoC
                  architectures using state-of-the-art advances in
                  programming language research. Namely, we are
                  investigating using dependent types and session
                  types for the description of hardware communication.
                  In this talk I will discuss my work in designing a
                  linked family of languages that captures and reasons
                  about the topological structure of a
                  System-on-a-Chip. These languages provide
                  correct-by-construction guarantees over the
                  interaction protocols themselves; the adherence of a
                  component that connects using said protocols; and
                  the validity of the specified connections. These
                  guarantees are provided through abuse of indexed
                  monads to reason about resource usage; and general
                  (ab)use of dependent types as presented in Idris.  I
                  will not cover all aspects of the languages but will
                  concentrate my talk detailing the underlying
                  theories that facilitate the correct-by-construction
                  guarantees.}
