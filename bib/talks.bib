                  investigating how to capture and reason about the

                  interaction protocols themselves; the adherence of a
                  component that connects using said protocols; and
                  the validity of the specified connections. These
                  guarantees are provided through abuse of indexed
                  monads to reason about resource usage; and general
                  (ab)use of dependent types as presented in Idris.  I
                  will not cover all aspects of the languages but will
